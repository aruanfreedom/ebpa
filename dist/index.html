                <p>Maria van der Hoeven took over as Executive Director of the IEA on 1 September 2011 and has led the Agency during a period of exceptional change in the global energy economy, as rapidly shifting supply/demand balances for oil and other major fuels transform the IEA’s traditional mandate. She has responded by enhancing IEA engagement with key non-member countries including Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa. Under her leadership, the IEA admitted its 29th member, Estonia, and increased its co-operation with OPEC and the International Energy Forum (IEF) as well as signed a partnership accord with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Ms. Van der Hoeven has repeatedly emphasised the close link between climate and energy policy. A member of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate led by former President Felipe Calderón of Mexico, she has initiated discussions at the IEA between policy makers and industry representatives on the impact of climate change on energy security, and sought to raise awareness among young people around the world of the problem of climate change and the need to get informed and take action. She has also promoted renewables and energy efficiency as part of the critical role she believes innovation and technology play in contributing to energy security while supporting climate goals, including expanding the IEA series of Medium-Term Market Reports to include annual critical analysis of both renewables and energy efficiency. These and her other initiatives at the IEA reflect her overall focus on energy security in all forms, for all people. That includes the hundreds of millions around the world who lack access to modern energy services, and in recognition of her efforts in this area, she was invited to serve on the Advisory Board for the UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative. Prior to leading the IEA, Ms. Van der Hoeven served as Minister of Economic Affairs of the Netherlands from February 2007 to October 2010, during which time she demonstrated leadership on energy policy at the national, regional and global levels. She also served as Dutch Minister of Education, Culture and Science from July 2002 to February 2007, having spent more than a decade before that as a member of parliament in her country.</p>

                <p>Professor Ramesh graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a Ph. D. in 1987. He returned to Berkeley in 2004 and is currently the Purnendu Chatterjee Chair Professor in Materials Science and Physics. Prior to that he was Distinguished University Professor at the University of Maryland College Park. From 1989-1995, at Bellcore, he initiated research in several key areas of oxide electronics, including ferroelectric nonvolatile memories. His landmark contributions in ferroelectrics came through the recognition that conducting oxide electrodes are the solution to the problem of polarization fatigue, which for 30 years, remained an enigma and unsolved problem. In 1994, in collaboration with S. Jin (Lucent Technologies), he initiated research into manganite thin films and they coined the term, Colossal Magnetoresistive (CMR) Oxides. At Berkeley, he continues to pursue key scientific and technological problems in complex multifunctional oxide thin films, nanostructures and heterostructures. His current research interests include thermoelectric and photovoltaic energy conversion in complex oxide heterostructures. He has published extensively on the synthesis and materials physics of complex oxide materials and his work is highly cited (over 35000 citations, H-factor =85). He received the Humboldt Senior Scientist Prize and Fellowship to the American Physical Society (2001). In 2005, he was elected a Fellow of American Association for the Advancement of Science as well as the David Adler Lectureship of the American Physical Society. In 2007, he was awarded the Materials Research Society David Turnbull Lectureship Award. In 2009, he was elected Fellow of MRS and is the recipient of the 2010 APS McGroddy New Materials Prize. From December 2010 to August 2012 he served as the Founding Director of the SunShot Initiative at the U.S. Department of Energy, overseeing and coordinate the R&amp;D activities of the U.S. Solar Program. In 2011, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering. From July 2013 to August 2014 he served as the Deputy Director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In September 2014, he returned to Berkeley and LBNL as the Associate Lab Director for Energy Technologies.</p>
